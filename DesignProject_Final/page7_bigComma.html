          What does a <span class="red-word red-word-blur">comma</span> do.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          I have refused them so often and left the out so much and did without them so continually that I have come finally to be<br>
          indifferent to them. I do not now care whether you put them in or not but for a long time Ifelt very definitely about them<br>
          and would have nothing to do with them.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          As I say commas are servile and they have no life of their own, and their use is not a use, it is a way of replacing oneâ€™s own<br>
          rest and I do decidedly like to like my own interest my own interest in what I am doing.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Complications make eventually for simplicity and therefore I have always liked dependent adverbial clauses. I have like<br>
          dependent adverbial clauses because of their variety of dependence and independence. You can see how loving the<br>
          intensity of complication of these things that commas would be degrading. Why if you want the pleasure of concentrating<br>
          on the final simplicity of excessive complication would you want any artificial aid to bring about that simplicity. Do you see<br>
          now why I feel about that simplicity. Do you see now why I feel about the comma as I did and as I do. Think about anything<br>
          you really like to do and you will see what I mean.

          When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to cut the knot, at least of anybody feels who is working<br>
          with any thread, so anybody feels who is working with any tool so anybody feels who is writing any sentence or reading it<br>
          after it has been written. And what does a comma do, a comma does nothing but make easy a thing that if you like it enough<br>
          is easy enough without the comma. A long complicated sentence should force itself upon you, make you know yourself<br>
          knowing it and the comma, well at the most a comma is a poor period that lets you stop and take a breath but if you want<br>
          to take a breath you ought to know yourself that you want to take a breath. It is not like stopping altogether has something<br>
          to do with going on, but <span class="red-word">taking a breath</span> well you are always taking a breath and why emphasize one breath rather than<br>
          another breath. Anyway that is the way I felt about it and I felt that about it very very strongly. And so I almost never used a<br>
          comma. The longer, the more complicated the sentence the greater the number of the same kinds of words I had following<br>
          one after another, the more the very more I had of them the more I felt the passionate need of their taking care of themselves<br>
          by themselves and not helping them, and thereby enfeebling them by putting in a comma.

          So that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose, in poetry it is a little different but more so and later I will go into that.<br>
          ut that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose.
